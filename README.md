RoboGames is This repository documents the projects completed for the RoboGames 2024 event. 

### Humanoid Stair Climbing Competition
The competition challenged participants to design and operate humanoid robots capable of effectively climbing a staircase autonomously. The robot that participated in the competition featured a bipedal configuration composed of two legs and a main body. This design allowed for human-like movement and efficient navigation of the staircase.

**Design Highlights:**
- Autonomous Operation: The robot was fully autonomous, relying on internal sensors and algorithms to navigate the staircase without human intervention.
- Bipedal Configuration: The two-legged design mimicked human walking, enabling the robot to handle complex terrain such as staircases with varying step heights and depths.
- Balance Maintenance: The robot successfully demonstrated the ability to maintain balance throughout the climb.
